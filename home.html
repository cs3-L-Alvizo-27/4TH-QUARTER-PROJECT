        <h1> Quantum Computing: Revolutionizing the Future of Technology </h1>
        <p id="first"> Quantum computing is an <strong>advanced branch of computer science that leverages the principles of quantum theory. </strong>
          Quantum theory investigates the behaviour of energy and matter on the atomic and subatomic levels. <br><br>
          By harnessing subatomic particles such as photons and electrons, quantum computing introduces
          a transformative approach to processing information.
          Quantum bits, also known as qubits, are crucial to quantum computing. Unlike classical bits, which can only represent a 0 or a 1, 
          qubits have the unique capacity to exist in several states at the same time, thanks to a phenomenon called superposition. This indicates that qubits can be either 0 or 1, or both.
          <br>
          Moreover, when qubits are entangled, they can interact in ways that allow them to <u>
          "exploit the interference between their wave-like quantum states to perform calculations
          that might otherwise take millions of years."</u> This interconnectedness and ability to handle 
          vast amounts of data simultaneously give quantum computers a significant edge over classical
          computers, which encode information in a binary stream of electrical impulses (1s and 0s), 
          limiting their processing capabilities.
          As quantum computing continues to evolve, it promises to revolutionize various fields by solving 
          complex problems that are currently beyond the reach of classical computers. This groundbreaking 
          technology holds the potential to transform industries ranging from cryptography and materials 
          science to pharmaceuticals and artificial intelligence.

            <dt> <strong>Understanding Quantum Computing</strong> </dt>
            <dd> &emsp;&emsp; Quantum computing emerged in the 1980s when researchers discovered that certain complex problems 
              could be solved more efficiently using quantum algorithms. Unlike classical computers, which use 
              bits to store information as 0s or 1s, quantum computers utilize qubits. These qubits hold information
              in quantum states that incorporate both 0 and 1 in a multidimensional form,
              vastly enhancing computational potential. <br><br>
            
              This immense potential has attracted major companies such as IBM, Microsoft, Google, D-Wave Systems,
              Alibaba, Nokia, Intel, Airbus, HP, Toshiba, Mitsubishi, SK Telecom, NEC, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin,
              Rigetti, Biogen, Volkswagen, and Amgen.
